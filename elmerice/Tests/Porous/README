Compile the Porous Solver
elmerf90 $ElmerIceLGGE/Solvers/PorousSolve.f90 $ElmerIceLGGE/Solvers/fAandfB_in.f90 -o PorousSolve

See the documentation (in DocSolverLGGE) of the Porous solver for the analytical solutions computed here with Elmer.
Numerical value for the analytical solutions are given in the exel file (in DocSolverLGGE)
