! NOTE: This file cannot be loaded as a separate file.
! It can be only included wihin a Panel section!

! NOTE: These fields are all predefined fields in ElmerFront, so they 'inherit'
! all the default properties and it is enough just to list the proper internal
! field names here in order to include them for user defined equation solvers.

Field = "Nonlinear System Label"
Field = "Nonlinear System Convergence Tolerance"
Field = "Nonlinear System Max Iterations"
Field = "Nonlinear System Newton After Iterations"
Field = "Nonlinear System Newton After Tolerance"
Field = "Nonlinear System Relaxation Factor"
