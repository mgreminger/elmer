! NOTE: This file cannot be loaded as a separate file.
! It can be only included within a Panel section!

! NOTE: These fields are all predefined fields in ElmerFront, so they 'inherit'
! all the default properties and it is enough just to list the proper internal
! field names here in order to include them for user defined equation solvers.

Field = "Linear System Label"
Field = "Linear System Solver"
Field = "Linear System Method"
Field = "Linear System Abort Not Converged"
Field = "Linear System Max Iterations"
Field = "Linear System Convergence Tolerance"
Field = "Linear System Preconditioning"
Field = "Linear System ILUT Tolerance"
Field = "Linear System Residual Output"
Field = "Steady State Convergence Tolerance"

! New field
Field = "Linear System Precondition Recompute"
   Label = "Lin.Sys.Precond. Recompute"
   Type = Integer
   Initial Value = 1
   Panel Frame = 2

! NOTE: These fields are internal 'helper' fields.
! They are needed for ElmerFront, but they will not be output to Sif file!
