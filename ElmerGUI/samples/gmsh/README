Gmsh is an automatic 3D finite element grid generator with a build-in
CAD engine and post-processor. Its design goal is to provide a simple
meshing tool for academic problems with parametric input and advanced
visualization capabilities. See http://www.geuz.org/gmsh/

gmsh files (with suffix .msh) may be read by ElmerGrid library.

Files t?.msh have been created from Gmsh tutorials using Gmsh version 
2.2.6 and saving the results in format 2.0 saving all geometric entities
(ignoring physical groups).
