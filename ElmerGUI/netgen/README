This directory contains a minimal source for building libng for ElmerGUI.
The source contains minor additions to Netgen's original source. The modified
files are:

libsrc/interface/nglib.h
libsrc/interface/nglib.cpp

Compilation (on all platforms):
-------------------------------
> qmake
> make

This will create the library ngcore/libng.a (unix) or ngcore/ng.lib (win32).
