This folder contains the GridDataMapper solver for Elmer
- Subdirectory /doc/ contains the documentation; look here to see how files connect to each other
- Subdirectory /src/ contains the source and implementation files
- For example compilation, cleaning, backups and packing can be done via Makefile
   ~ Note that the Makefile contains also comments
- Library dependencies are as follows:
	o NetCDF - the NetCDF Fortran90 libraries, path of which should be added to the Makefile includes
		~ Library files libnetcdff and libnetcdf path are defined, f.ex., with library flag "-L/usr/lib/ -lnetcdff -lnetcdf", where "/usr/lib/" is the path containing the files.
		~ Header files defined f.ex. in netcdf.* files in "-I/usr/include/"
	o DefUtils - the Elmer library files
	o Proj.4 - for cs2cs tools
		~ needs proj_api.h, often found f.ex. in "/usr/include/"
	o iso_c_binding - the files for C binding to Fortran
		~ should be included in the compiler
