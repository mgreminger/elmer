These are external scripts that are used for building ELMER. The main
purpose is to test the source on different platforms in an automated
way. As a side product, binaries and source tarballs are produced. 

Important scripts:

compile.sh     # Pull elmer from CVS and compile everything. Create
	       # source packages.
	       #
	       # Influental env variables:
	       # ELMER_USER      
	       # ELMER_CVSROOT
	       # NPROCS
	       # ELMER_MODULES
	       # ELMER_CHECK

elmer.nsi      # NSIS Windows installer creator script
 	       # run as > makensis elmer.nsi

*.sh	       # Set platform specific environment variables and call
	       # compile.sh
